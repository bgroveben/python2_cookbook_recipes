```
Mainly Cybersecurity and Testing projects, with a little of this and that thrown in.

I'm pretty sure that everything in here will be written in 2.7.x, but keep an eye out just in case.  
This repository is a collection of programs, files, books, magic spells, and so on.  
I will do my best to make sure all of my sources are properly attributed, so please bear with me.
